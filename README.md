AWS Ip Tools
============

Sometimes it's nice to see how much AWS IP space extends to help configure firewalls and so on.
The tools in this repository will operate on the AWS IP ranges JSON file:

[IP-Json-File](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/general/latest/gr/aws-ip-ranges.html)

Usage
=====

Expand out all of the IP network address blocks into specific IP Addresses.

+   ./bin/awsparser_ipaddr.py ./etc/sample-ip-ranges.json

NOTE: this may take a long time

Parse out network blocks:

+   ./bin/awsparser_ipblocks.py ./etc/sample-ip-ranges.json


NOTE: the consolidation seems to provide a 70% reduction in blocks.
